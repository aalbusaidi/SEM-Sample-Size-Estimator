# Motivation
Graduate students struggle estimating sample saize and power analysis when using Structrual Equation Modeling. Existing online tools require students to be able to determine degree of freedom (df). Some students struggle computing degree of freedom (counting known and unknown parameters), knowing that existing online tools to estimate sample size ask for _df_, this online tools help students determine _df_ and the results could be used to estimate sample size using this online tool or other online tools. 

# Description
This is an original web-based application to help graduate students estimate minimum sample size and power prior to data collection. Graduate students have used this tool, especially when estimating the degree of freedom of structural equation modeling.Please feel free to use it and make an impact by sharing it to your students who might find it helpful. The tool can estimate power and sample size of the following 

1.	Population/Sample estimation and margin of error
2.	ANOVA
3.	T-test
4.	Correlation
5.	CFA df
6.	SEM df
7.	SEM Sample Size
8.	SEM Power Analysis 
9.	Plotting SEM Power
